## **DOCUMENTATION**
The fundamental information regarding the underlying architecture, materials, and procedure for interacting with or constructing on top of existing technology is referred to as [technical documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_documentation). Documentation is required for all software development products, regardless of whether they were developed by a small group or a large corporation.<br>

*All the content fields including [copyediting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_editing), [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_translation#:~:text=Technical%20translation%20is%20a%20type,application%20of%20scientific%20and%20technological), [blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files etc fall under technical documentation domain.*<br>
Documentation was developed solely with the intention of making it simple for end users to comprehend a technology or product's architecture and work dynamics.<br>


Open-source contributing is a vast domain and starting out for the first time may be overwhelming, so we have tried to cater to each part of it by delivering the concepts more simply and inviting the contributors of the fields that will help the audience to contribute and know the tools! (all of it has been included in this repo.)
